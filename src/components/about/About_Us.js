    <p>Potable water being one of the most critical needs of mankind, next to oxygen, triggered our journey to deliver pure & hygienic drinking water at the doorstep of every Pakistani resident at an affordable price, quality & timely service. Though water supply from local government is available in certain parts of Pakistan, it is generally not considered safe enough to drink until it undergoes several filtering & processing steps. Indeed there are multiple filtered water suppliers who deliver unknown labels, charge hefty price with poor quality and delivery service. There are also a few suppliers who deliver branded mineral water at a very high price thus making it unaffordable for daily household usage and even for businesses! This is where Online Water Supply envisioned to build a platform that can connect & bring the filtered as well as mineral water resources from the neighborhood to the door step of Pakistani resident ensuring highest water quality, affordable price & most important â€“ timely service. We are currently piloting our service to individual homes and businesses in  localities such as Towns, cites. After receiving a phenomenal customer response, we are now expanding our journey to other localities of Pakistan and to other cities across the nation. Stay tuned and get ready to quench your thirst for a safe, great-tasting, pure water.</p>
